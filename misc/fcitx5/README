Fcitx is an input method framework with extension support. Currently it
supports Linux and Unix systems like freebsd. Fcitx supports typing
with many languages all over the world with a large number of engines.

Fcitx has a slim core while provides powerful features with addons. It
is easy to customize fcitx to satisfy your own needs. 

Fcitx5 is the next generation of fcitx.

Some cmake options to keep in mind before building are:

- ENABLE_WAYLAND: Wayland support. Defaults to On and should be fine
  for desktop environments such as KDE and GNOME. Users running
  X11-based window managers will need to turn it off.

- ENABLE_ENCHANT: Enchant support. Defaults to On. Used for word
  prediction (hinting). Depends on libenchant, which is provided by
  most distributions.

The user is encouraged to check the contents of CMakeLists.txt for an
exhaustive list of options.

For example, an i3 user who wishes to install it to /opt would run
(likely with sudo privileges):

    cmake -DENABLE_WAYLAND=Off \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/install/path .
    make
    sudo make install

To make fcitx5 the default input method, please add these lines to your
/etc/environment (or .profile):

    GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
    QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
    XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
