# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xcb-imdkit: has a smaller memory footprint, better performance, and is safer on
xcb-imdkit: malformed clients. And not to say it's all asynchronous and it works
xcb-imdkit: with xcb.
