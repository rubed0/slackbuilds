xcb-imdkit is an implementation of the xim protocol in xcb. Compared
with the implementation of IMDkit with Xlib, and xim inside Xlib, it
has a smaller memory footprint, better performance, and is safer on
malformed clients. And not to say it's all asynchronous and it works
with xcb.

To build this project, you need: libxcb, xcb-util, xcb-util-keysym,
which are all included in a full Slackware installation.
