Fcitx5-configtool provides the configuration GUI for Fcitx5.

Do note that although this package could be installed along with the 
bundled kcm-fcitx, they are considered conflicting packages in some
other distros (like Arch), so depending on your situation, you may
uninstall and blacklist kcm-fcitx before installing this package.
